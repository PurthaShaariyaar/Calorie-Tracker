The purpose of this assignment is to develop a Calorie Tracking App with a connection to a database in order to store food items. The app will enable users to select a target calories per day and ensure that the food items in the meal plan do not go over that limit. The user will be able to view the meal plan to see the recommended amount of calories. Also, the functionality will ensure the user is able to create, read, update and destroy any food items.
